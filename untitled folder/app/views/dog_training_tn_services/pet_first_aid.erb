        Nashville K-9 and the Nashville Red Cross have teamed up to bring you a Red Cross Authorized Pet First Aid course. Your pet depends on you for his or her well-being. In addition to providing daily care, love and affection, your best friend depends on you in an emergency. Whether your pet becomes ill or injured, or needs help in a disaster, the American Red Cross can help.
        Learn basic information on how to recognize and care for emergencies, illness and injuries in cats and dogs. Participants learn rescue breathing, CPR and care for choking pets, and first aid for bleeding, fractures, poisonings, illness, and much more.
