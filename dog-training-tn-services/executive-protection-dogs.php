At Nashville K-9, we have taken the appropriate steps to ensure our unmatched experience in obtaining and training a potential personal protection dog for you. One of the main differences between ourselves and our competitors is that we are police officers. Our ceritfications go above the average patrol officer to include (TLETA) S.W.A.T. Operator, K-9 Unit Director, and K-9 Handler.  In addition, we have completed multiple K-9 Tactical schools. What this means for you as our client: we incorporate all our law enforcement wisdom and training into your unique situation.

Some people think a  titled sport dog is always enough to protect their home. They also think because a trainer has gone to a dog behavior school  or titled several sport dogs that he or she is capable of handling the task of trainng a pesonal protection dog. In our experience, this is simply not a fact. While there are titled dogs capable of personal protection, not all titled dogs are, and that's where we come into play. As law enforcement officers, we have seen and know how to recognize key points of vulnerability in a home, business, or travel situation and are trained to neutralize those weaknesses. We train upwards of five hundred dogs each year, logging multple thousands of hours in training. We are one of the primary resources in middle Tennessee for police departments and rescue squads, overseeing and directing all training and national certifications for several different departments.

With three main levels of protection, we can match the appropriate level of security based on your lifestyle needs. Each hand-selected protection dog undergoes an immense amount of training, imprinting based on real world situations, and meticulous health screenings. They will be prepared for your specific needs to provide a sense of security for your family and home. Every dog will have its hips, elbows, and health certified. Titled dogs will have DNA tests conducted, and will have been approved for the highest breeding standards. We will provide you with documents certifying your dogâ€™s health, X-Rays, vaccination records, and all certification or titling paperwork.
</p>

<p>
We will place you in a two day course of instruction at your home or place of business to teach you how to properly use your protection dog, create good habits, and take care of your new family member. This helps integrate your dog with current family members and pets and teach everyone the correct way to enjoy this special companion. With our own FAA licensed pilot on staff, we can deliver your dog directly to you or provide you with our private jet service to our Nashville facility regardless of your location. We guarantee training for the life of your dog.
