We offer several programs, which include scent discrimination trailing, wilderness air scenting (bark or re-find alert), Bark Alert, and Cadaver Recovery . Some of these areas can be cross-trained. Please visit the Search and Rescue Page.
Our SWAT K-9 training is based on National Tactical Officer’s Association standards, as well as the Tennessee Tactical Officer’s Association.
We have one S.W.A.T. K-9 Police Dog, and she is the only one of six S.W.A.T. canines to complete the NTOA recognized course in the State of Tennessee. She is also the ONLY canine that’s not municipality owned and ready for S.W.A.T. deployment. She was raised, trained, and titled by Nashville K-9.
