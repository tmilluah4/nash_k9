        With three main levels of protection, we can match the appropriate level of security based on your lifestyle needs.
        Each hand-selected protection dog undergoes an immense amount of training, imprinting based on real world
        situations, and meticulous health screenings. They will be prepared for your specific needs to provide a sense
        of security for your family and home.   Every dog will have its hips, elbows, eyes, and health certified,
        DNA tests conducted, and will have been approved by a panel of judges for the highest breeding
        standards (KKL1). We will provide you with documents certifying your dog’s health, X-Rays, vaccination records,
        and all certification or titling paperwork.
