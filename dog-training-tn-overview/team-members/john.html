		  Favorite Breeds: Labrador Retriever and Belgian Malinois. Mazda was rescued in June 2006. She was a little rough around the edges but since then has become an excellent companion. She is excellent around all individuals especially children. She loves to go to training and the dog park and is very affectionate enjoying all dogs as friends. She is more inquisitive than intrusive, she loves to roam through plastic bags or purses. She also loves going to Nursing homes to visit and spend time with those who do not always have visitors. If you would like to see Mazda come out to the dog park
		  or training and she would love to have you pet her.
