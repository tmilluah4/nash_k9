		  Ali Hemyari is the only civilian K-9 trainer in the state of Tennessee that has completed and graduated a police mandated S.W.A.T. K-9 School that is recognized by the National Tactical Officers’ Association (NTOA K-9). As a tenured Police Officer, he commands two Police Department K-9 teams and two Rescue Rquad K-9 teams with a total of 9 handlers under his direction at no charge to tax payers.

He has trained all across the United States with various dogs stemming from small Chihuahuas to large Mastiffs. His participation in several Trials and Trainings across the world has led him to be considered one of the best trainers in the Southeast United States and his affiliations quench his thirst for ongoing knowledge and learning.
