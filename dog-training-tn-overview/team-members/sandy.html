		  Sandy Pope is an expert on the Doberman Pinscher breed. Her dream is to re-establish the respectful reputation
		  that is due the Doberman and return them to the services which they have been bred for. She has bred, raised,
		  and trained dogs for over 25 years and competes in regional schutzhund trials all across the United States. She
		  has completed several Schutzhund titles, including titling to ScH 3 from a puppy.
